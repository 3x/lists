# lists
A collection of line-separated values I use for testing. They've helped me out a lot, so hopefully they'll be of some use for you, too.

These lists contain:
- All possible character combinations of lengths 1-4
- The 100, 1000, and 3000 most common English words (according to [EF](https://www.ef.com/wwen/english-resources/english-vocabulary/))
- All 1, 2, 3, and 4 letter English words (according to the [TWL06](https://www.wordgamedictionary.com/twl06/download/twl06.txt) dictionary)

For all possible character combination lists, the following key is used:

|Key|Definition|Examples|
|---|----------|--------|
|`l`|Letter|a, b, ... z|
|`n`|Number|0, 1... 9|
|`c`|Character|0, 1... 9, a, b... z|
